Minecraft Curse Forge Pack

Valkyrie presents Jurassic Colonies, A new take on the Mine Colonies pack. Made for a private server and now released to the public!
We wanted a cool modpack that also has dinosaurs.

 

Assembled as a pack that's Mine Colonies but more incentive for exploration a few branching paths of the World.

Such as Fossil and Archeology Revival, Here to bring the once dead reptiles back to life or the Between lands for a dangerous adventure, With Mutant Creatures and Ice and Fire in Tow to make sure the Overworld isn't the warm cozy place you were used to.

 

Overall this pack should have everything needed for the Explorer to the Builder.

 

Feel free to add the Latest Opti fine for 1.12.2.
